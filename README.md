### Hello there 👋

I am Hycient Onyeukwu, a software engineer residing in PortHarcourt, Nigeria.

I'm passionate about bringing new ideas to reality by the development of web applications and back-end APIs, with the use of modern web technologies.

Excluding developing technologies, I believe there is need in rolling out clean, reusable, testable and maintainable bug free code to improve the efficiency of a product and its scalability as it progresses in growth, by implementation of industry based standard of writing and deploying code. 

- 🌴 Aside developing technologies, I am currently learning C# programming langauge and .Net for building web applications, and advanced algorithms for manipulating complex data structures.

- 🚪 I am open to front-end roles for both full-time and contract gigs.

- 🏸 Aside tech, for leisure, I also play the keyboard, guitar and violin, badminton for sports, and try to learn at least one thing a day about other fields outside tech.
