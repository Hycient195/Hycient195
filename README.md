### Hello there 👋

I am Hycient Onyeukwu, a full-stack software engineer residing in Nigeria.

I'm passionate about bringing new ideas to reality by the development of web applications and back-end APIs, with the use of modern web technologies.

Excluding developing technologies, I believe there is need in rolling out clean, reusable, testable and maintainable bug free code to improve the efficiency of a product and its scalability as it progresses in growth, by implementation of industry based standard of writing and deploying code. 

- 🌴 Aside developing technologies, I am currently learning C# for building web applications using ASP.Net, and intermediate to advanced algorithms for manipulating complex data structures.

- 🚪 I am open to front-end roles for both full-time and contract gigs, as well as junior level back-end roles, you can contact me via any of the provided media on the left of this page.

- ♿ I'll be needing help with quite some connections to opportunities and offers. Over the last couple of years I have devoted a large amount of my time to writing code, solving algorithms and other software related problems, and I'll really appreciate an opportunity to collaborate on challenging and interesting projects.

- 🏸 Aside tech, for leisure, I also play the keyboard, guitar and violin, badminton for sports, and try to learn at least one thing a day about other fields outside tech.
